### Important things to note? <a id='tip1'></a>

- _DOTEbase_ looks for projects and transcripts created with _DOTE_.
- A DOTEspace is the central organising unit
- Transcrips cannot be edited in _DOTEbase_.
Use the [Transcript Editor](https://bigsoftvideo.github.io/DOTE/howto.html) in _DOTE_ instead.
- Media cannot be added in _DOTEbase_.
Use the [Media Manager](https://bigsoftvideo.github.io/DOTE/media.html) in _DOTE_ instead.
- Projects cannot be created in _DOTEbase_.
Use _DOTE_ instead to [manage Projects](https://bigsoftvideo.github.io/DOTE/projects.html).
- _DOTEbase_ stores a local cache of the watch folders in every [DOTEspace](dotespace.md).
The [DOTEspace Crawler](glossary.md#crawl) searches all watch folders and updates the cache at startup and when changes are detected.
- Changes made to a DOTEspace, clip or collection are immediate and irreversible.
There is no undo mechanism.
The exception is the [Canvas](canvas.md), which has undo/redo functionality.
- [Transcript Clips](transcript-clip.md) added in _DOTE_ to any Transcript in a watch folder will be detected by the [DOTEspace Crawler](glossary.md#crawl) when the Transcript is saved.
- All data and meta-data used by _DOTEbase_ is unencrypted.
Use your own software/hardware encryption.
- All data and meta-data is local to the computer.
Nothing is uploaded to the web or cloud.
