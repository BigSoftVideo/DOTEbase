## What is new in _DOTE_?

To be able to use _DOTEbase_, you must update _DOTE_ to at least v1.1.0+.

The main changes are as follows:

1. Support for creating, viewing and deleting Transcript Clips in the Transcript panel.
2. Support for importing and exporting Transcripts and Projects with Transcript Clips.
3. Support for importing and exporting Projects with Media Clips.
Note that Media Clips are not viewable in _DOTE_, only in _DOTEbase_, but the meta-data is still stored in each Project.
4. Support for tracking changes to Clips in Checkpoints and Autobackups.

Users of the Free edition of _DOTE_ will only be able to _view_ Transcript Clips that others have exported and shared with them.
They will not be able to edit them in any way.

NOTE that when a Transcript (in a Project) is currently open in _DOTE_, then that Transcript is locked in _DOTEbase_ if it is contained in the currently open DOTEspace.
This is necessary to avoid competing changes being made in both _DOTE_ and _DOTEbase_ to the same Transcript Clip.
