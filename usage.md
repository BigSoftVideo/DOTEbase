## How to use DOTEbase

There several classic ways that _DOTEbase_ can support working qualitatively with an audio-visual and/or transcript corpus.

### Getting a grip on an audio-visual corpus of data recordings

Often when confronted with a new set of data recordings, one can be overwhelmed.
One of the key reasons we developed _DOTEbase_ was to be able to start to make sense of a large corpus of audio and video recordings of an event.
To start at the beginning, one can work with the audio-visual media and make notes using Media Clips on anything noticeable as one wades through the corpus, watching hours and hours of recorded data.

### Transitioning from the audio-visual data to transcribing

An extension of the previous strategy is to make a first pass through the audio-visual archive, identifying interesting fragments via Media Clips.
When enough of a picture of interesting phenomena has been established, then one can open the blank transcripts created in _DOTE_ and start transcribing the relevant passages marked by the generated Media Clips.

### Adding a bunch of disparate already created transcripts (and their media sources) to a DOTEspace

Another research methodology is to collect recordings from disparate social events and to find patterns across all instances of something very broad, such as everyday conversation, or more narrow, such as doctor-patient interaction.
_DOTEbase_ supports this, too.
A team could create and edit transcripts on a broad range of cases, then assemble all the DOTE projects/transcripts into a common archive and create a DOTEspace that includes them all.
New audio-visual data and/or transcripts can be added to the DOTEspace at any time.

### Making notes while transcribing (and after)

In _DOTE_ itself, one can just start transcribing from scratch and add Transcript Clips as one notices specific phenomena or incidents.
All of these Clips will be available in _DOTEbase_ when a DOTEspace is created later.
One can make repeated passes over the emerging transcripts to add more and more Transcript Clips.

### Making comments on students' transcripts in _DOTE_

A simple use case without _DOTEbase_ is to add comments using Transcript Clips to students' attempts to transcribe using DOTE.
Just have the student(s) export their Project and/or Transcript and share it.
Import the Project and/or Transcript into _DOTE_ and add as many Transcript Clips with notes as you wish.
When finished, export the Transcript and share it with the student.
Transcript Clips are viewable (read only) even to users of the free Edition of _DOTE_.
One might also make changes and edits to the transcript, but then [Checkpoints] are a better way of tracking precise changes in _DOTE_.

### Keeping track of students' transcripts in _DOTEbase_

An extension of the previous strategy is to use _DOTEbase_ to keep track of all the Transcript Clip notes made about a cohort of students' transcripts that were marked up in _DOTE_.
A teacher can use _DOTEbase_ to create a DOTEspace that includes all of the students' transcripts and search for patterns across all the students' work, and use it to present the students' work in class.
For example, the teacher can have multiple transcripts open at the same time by different students and/or the teacher for comparison.
And the teacher could search Clips for specific comments they made and view the transcript lines in every search result.
