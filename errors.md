## Warnings and Errors

Sometimes _DOTEbase_ reports errors and warnings.
These often appear temporarily at the top of the window and then disappear.
There is a log of these errors and warnings under `Help/Shows Recent Errors and Warnings` menu item.

Some of the errors and warnings may not make much sense.
If you are reporting a problem to the developers, then it may be useful to send the log files as well.
You can copy the errors log and the warnings log to the clipboard and paste into a document.
