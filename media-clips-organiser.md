## How to use the Media Clips Organiser

Media Clips can be created and edited from the Media Clips Organiser panel.

A key feature of the Media Clips Organiser is the ability to create Tiers to which Media Clips can be assigned.
This feature allows users to create colour-coded channels to better visualise individual clips in the Timeline.
Note that these have nothing to do with Transcripts and are not a form of score-based transcription (such as found in ELAN).

- Any number of Tiers can be created (name and colour).
- Use the Settings in the Media Clips Organiser to adjust the colour and order of the Tiers.
- Media Clips can be assigned to any Tier.
- Clips can be moved between Tiers using the Clip Move mode.
- Clips can be locked to avoid accidental movement or adjustment.
- Clips can be adjusted in length using the Adjust boundaries mode.
- Clip details (Tag, UDF) can be shown in Clip objects in all Tiers.
