## Logfile

_DOTEbase_gives friendly errors and warnings as best it can.
Some of these may be useful for the developers to debug a problem you might have.

Besides appearing in a pop-error error/warning box, one can see a history of errors and warnings in the current session from the `Help/Show recent errors and warnings` menu.
