## Colour Swatch Manager

The Colour Swatch Manager manages the Colours that are available in and across DOTEspaces in regard to Clips and Tiers.

To open the Colour Swatch Manager, click on the colour swatch when editing a T-Clip or an M-Clip, or for a Tier in the Settings for the Media Clips Organiser.
A panel opens up on the right side.

A colour can be selected by clicking on the colour wheel, entering a value or clicking on a swatch.
The primary swatch will change colour to the value selected.

If you wish to return to the previous colour before experimenting with swatchs in the Manager, then click the `Revert to Previous Colour button` when applicable.

### Default Colours

Users can use a full range of colours to label their [Clips](clips.md) and [Tiers](media-clips-organiser.md).
The colours can be chosen from a colour wheel or entered using its HEX or RGB value and clicking the save button (tick).
For some functions, a transparency value (RGBA) can be selected to avoid one T-Clip occluding another in the Transcript.

The user can also select from a Default set of Colours listed as Swatches that are always available when using _DOTEbase_.

### Using Preset Colours

An alternative is for the user to create named Colours as Presets and assemble them in a separate Swatch palette at the DOTEspace level, ie. your presets are available for any Clip or Tier in a single DOTEspace, though they can be applied in other DOTEspaces later.
To save the current colour displayed in the primary swatch, click `Save as DOTEspace Preset` and enter a unique name.
Select a DOTEspace to save the colour to and click `Save`.

### Scope of Colour Swatch Sets

The currently active Colours, including Default, user-specified and saved Presets, can be viewed by scope, eg. locally and by DOTEspace:
- Only those in the local Transcript or Project are shown.
- Only those in the current DOTEspace are shown.
- All are shown across all DOTEspaces.

An indication of the scope of any set of swatches is indicated by an icon, eg. `D` for DOTEspace, `P` for Project and `T` for Transcript-Clip.

Swatch sets are also divided into Saved Presets by DOTEspace and local Transcript or Media Clips.

It is not possible to filter in any other way (yet).
