## What is the scope of the different tools and capabilities in _DOTEbase_?

Because each tool works with specific data and meta-data, it is very important that users appreciate exactly what each tool is working with.
The list below consists of all the major tools and capabilities found in _DOTEbase_.

It is not limited to one DOTEspace or watch folder.
