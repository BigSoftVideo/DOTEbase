# What is _DOTEbase_?

_DOTEbase_ is our prototype software package that is designed to support qualitative analysis of large audio-visual data sets.

We built it because we wanted a software tools to help researchers to analyse larger corpora of data, either before they have been transcribed or after.

It piggybacks on sets of transcripts created using _DOTE_ that are stored on the same computer or are accessible via an external drive or remote file system.

It maintains a local snapshot of all the transcripts that is updated in the background. As much data as possible is stored locally with the transcripts, so if something goes wrong, then the snapshot can be reconstructed again.
If a remote drive goes offline, then _DOTEbase_ will use the cached version until it comes online again.

It provides a range of tools to annotate, tag, make clips, collect clips and make visual mind maps of the data over time.

### What does _DOTEbase_ stand for?

DOTEbase is derivative of [_DOTE_, our lovely transcription software package that was released in October 2022](https://www.dote.aau.dk).
_DOTE_ is an acronym for _Distributed Open Transcription Environment_.
By extension, _DOTEbase_ is a Distributed Open Transcription Environment _database_.

### Is _DOTEbase_ for you?

If you need a tool to get a better grip on your audio-visual data and/or transcripts, then _DOTEbase_ is for you.
It is designed to support qualitative analysis.
There are plenty of software tools to support quantitative analysis, but not so many to innovatively support how we do qualitative research in the social sciences and humanities.
It has been designed by qualitative researchers in discourse studies and social interaction in education/learning.

### How do I try _DOTEbase_?

If you purchase _DOTE_, then _DOTEbase_ is free.
If you have already purchased _DOTE_ before _DOTEbase_ was released, then it is free.
_DOTEbase_ is a standalone software package, but it relies entirely on _DOTE_.

See the instructions to register _DOTEbase_ using your _DOTE_ [license](license.md).

### How do I get help?

There is a lot to get familiar with, but we hope it is worth it.
Please read carefully the [help guide](help.md), which provides instructions to get you started with the basic transcription tasks using _DOTE_.
There are plenty of [video tutorials](tutorials.md) available as well.

Thanks and have fun, [_Dote Team_](contributing.md)
