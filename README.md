# What is _DOTEbase_?

_DOTEbase_ is our prototype software package that is designed to support qualitative analysis of large audio-visual data sets.

We built it because we wanted a software tools to help researchers to analyse larger corpora of data, either before they have been transcribed or after.

It piggybacks on sets of transcripts created using DOTE that are stored on the same computer or are accessible via an external drive or remote file system.

It maintains a local snapshot of all the transcripts that is updated in the background. As much data as possible is stored locally with the transcripts, so if something goes wrong, then the snapshot can be reconstructed again.
If a remote drive goes offline, then _DOTEbase_ will use the cached version until it comes online again.

It provides a range of tools to annotate, tag, make clips, collect clips and make visual mind maps of the data over time.
