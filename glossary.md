## Glossary of key terms in _DOTEbase_

A familiarity with _DOTE_ is not essential when annotating and tagging audio-visual media in _DOTEbase_ workspaces, but other functionality is dependent on a working knowledge of _DOTE_ projects and transcripts.
See our [online help guide for _DOTE_](https://bigsoftvideo.github.io/DOTE/), which has more information on getting started with _DOTE_.

Below is a list of key terms in alphabetical order with short definitions and links to relevant help pages for more information.

We call the first a _Media Clip_.
It saves the IN and OUT points of a segment in an audio or video file imported into a [_DOTE_ project](#dote-project) that is in a [Watch Folder](#watch-folder) in a [DOTEspace](#dotespace).
The second we call a _Transcript Clip_.
It saves the starting character/line and ending character/line in a transcript file imported into a [_DOTE_ project](#dote-project) that is in a [Watch Folder](#watch-folder) in a [DOTEspace](#dotespace).

### Clip Collection <a id='clip-collection'></a>

### Comment <a id='comment'></a>

A Comment is a text field attached to [Clips](#clip).

### Crawl <a id='crawl'></a>

A Crawl is a background process that maintains the integrity of all current [DOTEspaces](#dotespace) by scanning all the [Watch Folders](#watch-folder).
Because [DOTE projects](#dote-project) can be stored on media that go offline, or projects and [transcripts](#dote-transcript) can be created or renamed, the _DOTEbase_ has to be check regularly to keep everything up-to-date.
It can also be initiated manually.

### DOTE Project <a id='dote-project'></a>

A DOTE Project is a container created using our _DOTE_ software.
It consists of all temporally synchronised media files and all [Transcripts](#dote-transcript) associated with one continuous event.

### DOTE Transcript <a id='dote-transcript'></a>

A DOTE Transcript is a transcript created using our _DOTE_ software.
It is a specific textual object that is contained within a [DOTE Project](#dote-project).

### DOTEspace  <a id='workspace'></a>

A DOTEspace is a workspace for working on thematically organised sets of DOTE projects and transcripts that are distributed across your file system.

### License <a id='license'></a>

A License is an encrypted file that is used to authenticate the user of _DOTEbase_ (as a purchaser of _DOTE_).
Without a valid license, _DOTEbase_ cannot be used.

### Media Clip <a id='clips.md#media'></a>

### Timeline <a id='timeline'></a>

The Timeline is a linear graphical representation of time passed in a specific [_DOTE_ Transcript](#dote-transcript).

See [Waveform](#waveform).

### User-defined Field <a id='user-defined'></a>

It has a name and a value.
For example, the name could be defined in terms of a phenomenon, and a set of values used that qualify that phenomenon or a boolean value (yes/no) that can record if it is present or not in the Clip.
User-defined Fields are searchable.

### Virtual Table Top <a id='tabletop'></a>

A Virtual Table Top (VTT) is a visual representation of states and relationships between a variety of objects in and across [DOTEspaces](#dotespace).
For example, representations of [Transcript Clips](#transcript-clip), [Media Clips](#media-clip), [Tags](#tag), [Clip Collections](#clip-collection), etc. can be dragged and dropped onto the independent VTT.
Relationships between objects can be constructed out of a set of basic lines and borders.
