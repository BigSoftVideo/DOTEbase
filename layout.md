## DOTEbase layout and user interface

The DOTEbase UI has a lot of flexibility.
Panels can be added and removed, resized and relocated in relation to other panels.
Also, some panels can have multiple instances, eg. Transcript and Search panels can have more than one instance, so that one can start multiple searches at the same time or open multiple transcripts simultaneously.
