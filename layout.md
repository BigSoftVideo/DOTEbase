## DOTEbase layout and user interface

The _DOTEbase_ UI has a lot of flexibility.
Panels can be added and removed, resized and relocated in relation to other panels.
Also, some panels can have multiple instances, eg. Transcript and Search panels can have more than one instance, so that one can start multiple searches at the same time or open multiple transcripts simultaneously.

For ease of use, _DOTEbase_ should restore the last used layout every time when restarts _DOTEbase_.

There is the option to switch between several predefined layouts.

- Click the `Layouts` button and a menu will appear.
  - Panel settings - Panel Tabs can be hidden to get more screen estate.
  - Default layouts - A list of predefined layouts for specific tasks common to all DOTEbase users.
  - Custom user layouts - The current layout can be saved as a custom layout.
Custom layouts are listed and can be deleted.

Predefined layouts include:

- _Starting_ layout - to get started for readability when screen estate is limited
- _Media clipping_ layout - just for clipping media sources
- _Transcript_ clipping layout - just for clipping transcripts
- _Searching_ layout - to prioritise search panels
- _Comparing Transcripts_ layout - great for comparing multiple transcripts in panels side-by-side or over-under
- _Managing Clip Collections_ layout - for working on your clips and collections
- _The Works!_ High resolution screen (4K) - the kitchen sink!

Later we will allow users to export and share their own layouts.
We encourage trading in layouts for specific purposes.
