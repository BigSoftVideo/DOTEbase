## DOTEbase layout and user interface

The _DOTEbase_ UI has a lot of flexibility.
Panels can be added and removed, resized and relocated in relation to other panels.
Also, some panels can have multiple instances, eg. Transcript and Search panels can have more than one instance, so that one can start multiple searches at the same time or open multiple transcripts simultaneously.

For ease of use, _DOTEbase_ should restore the last used layout every time.

There is the option to switch between several predefined layouts.
Predefined layouts include:

- Media clipping focus - just for clipping media sources
- Transcript clipping focus - just for clipping transcripts
- Transcripts focus - great for comparing multiple transcripts in panels side-by-side or over-under
- Clip organising focus - for working on your clips and collections
- Searching focus - to prioritise search panels
- Low resolution screen (large font HD) - for readability when screen estate is limited
- High resolution screen (4K) - the kitchen sink!
- Wide screen - when there is lots of horizontal screen estate

Later we will allow users to name, save, share and import their own layouts.
We encourage trading in layouts for specific purposes.
