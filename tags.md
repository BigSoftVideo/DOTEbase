## How to Tag your Clips

Any Media Clip or Transcript Clip can have multiple Tags assigned to it.
Tags are entered when creating the clip.
Recent tags in the DOTEspace are autocompletable.
Tags can also be edited in currently existing Clips.

Tags are searchable and listable in Clip listings in the Media Clips Organiser and the Canvas.

Later, a Tag manager will be created in _DOTEbase_ to enable the user to add, delete and rename tags.
