## How to use the Media Player

The Media Player displays an audio-visual source for playback in _DOTEbase_.
It is very similar to the media player in _DOTE_.
The video view will be resized to fit the panel.

The Media Player only plays back media in combination with the [Timeline](timeline.md) tool, ie. the Timeline has to be open at the same time in the _DOTEbase_ layout, otherwise only a still image is displayed at the current playhead position.

The source can be viewed in different ways.

1. One format is derived from the Video-cues created in _DOTE_ for the Project in question.
2. Another format is the last known saved view for this media in the Project in _DOTE_.
3. A third format is the last known saved view for this media in _DOTEbase_ itself.
This has no connection to views in _DOTE_.

The media can be played using the same shortcuts and buttons as familiar in DOTE_.
