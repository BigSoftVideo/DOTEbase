## Exporting and importing a DOTEspace

A single DOTEspace can be exported and shared with others.

An exported DOTEspace can be imported into DOTEbase by another user.

NOTE that if there are any clips from other DOTEspaces in Collections associated with a DOTEspace to be exported, then those external clips will not be exported.

NOTE that an exported DOTEspace is not encrypted.
If you share it with someone else, then all the media files and any Transcripts are openly accessible.
If this concerns you, then encrypt the DOTEspace export file using your preferred hardware or software encryption.
