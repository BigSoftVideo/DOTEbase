## How to setup a DOTEspace

Any number of DOTEspaces can be created using the DOTEspaces panel.
Each DOTEspace is assigned one or more watch folders in which DOTE Projects and Transcripts are scanned and loaded as a snapshot into _DOTEbase_.

_DOTEbase_ automatically scans the current DOTEspace for updates.
This is called crawling because _DOTEbase_ must look in all files, folders and subfolders in every watch folder.
This is necessary so that any changes found in the watch folders can be incorporated into the current snapshot.
If required, the user can manually start the crawl using the button at the top of the DOTEspace panel.

More than one watch folder is allowed in any DOTEspace so that users can keep their DOTE projects/transcripts in multiple locations and on external mapped drives.
All that is required is that the DOTE projects/transcripts under each watch folder are to be included in the relevant DOTEspace.
Individual projects and transcripts can be removed once the DOTEspace is scanned by toggling them off in the DOTEspace viewer.

It is important to appreciate the [scope of a DOTEspace and other functions](scope.md) in _DOTEbase_.
