## How to use the Lego Demo DOTEspace

The Lego Demo DOTEspace is an artificial working DOTEspace designed to show off many of the features of _DOTEbase_.

The Demo contains the original Lego Demo Project data, which can be downloaded for _DOTE_ separately.
However, the media files and the transcripts have been split into 3 separate _DOTE_ projects.
Doing do enables us to demonstrate how _DOTEbase_ can work with independent _DOTE_ projects and transcripts (in a single DOTEspace) that are spread out on the file system.

At present, only one DOTEspace can be [exported and imported](export.md) at one time.

### How to download and import the demo DOTEspace

To download the demo DOTEspace beta version, follow the instructions given by the developers.
You will need to make sure you have enough space for the download (1.7GB) and the same again to import it into DOTEbase.
After import, you can delete the downloaded file.

1. Select `Import` from `File` menu.
2. Locate the file that you downloaded and import.
3. The DOTEspace should appear in the list of DOTEspaces in the DOTEspaces panel.
4. Have fun exploring the demo!
