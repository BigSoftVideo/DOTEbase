## How to use the Lego Demo DOTEspace

The Lego Demo DOTEspace is an artificial working DOTEspace designed to show off many of the features of _DOTEbase_.

The Demo contains the original Lego Demo Project data, which can be downloaded for _DOTE_ separately.
However, the media files and the transcripts have been split into 3 separate _DOTE_ projects.
Doing do enables us to demonstrate how _DOTEbase_ can work with independent _DOTE_ projects and transcripts (in a single DOTEspace) that are spread out on the file system.

At present, only one DOTEspace can be [exported and imported](export.md) at one time.
