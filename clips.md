## How to use Clips

Because qualitative researchers wish to make notes on specific fragnents of their media data, as well as specific lines/characters in their transcripts (made with _DOTE_), _DOTEbase_ provides tools to create a 'clip' of a media file or a transcript.

There are two types of clips in _DOTEbase_:

1. [Media Clip](media-clip.md) - notes and tags attached to a short stretch of an audiovisual file.
2. [Transcript Clip](transcript-clip.md) - notes and tags attached to a delimited section of an in progress transcript created and edited in DOTE.
