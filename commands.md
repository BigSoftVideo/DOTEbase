There may be divergences in how different operating systems (macOS versus Windows) or laptops deal with the mouse, function keys and keyboard shortcuts.
For example, for Windows users, the modifier keys are <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>ALT</kbd>.
However, for macOS users, the equivalent modifier keys are <kbd>⌘</kbd> and <kbd>⌥</kbd>, but <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> is not used.

For all users:
- Function keys may require an extra keypress (eg. <kbd>FN</kbd>) on your laptop.
- Scrolling on a touchpad using two fingers may be an alternative to a mouse scroll wheel.

For macOS users:
- For reference, here is a [guide to using <kbd>Right Click</kbd> on macOS](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/right-click-3610351/).
- Here is a [guide to the Emoji Picker on macOS](https://www.imore.com/how-to-use-emoji-on-your-mac).
